        <p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae of the order Sphenisciformes. They live
        almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator
    Penguins are stocky with short, strong legs. Prehistoric penguins stood 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. Today the largest
    penguin is the emperor penguin, which is about 45 inches (115 centimeters) tall and weighs about 55–90 pounds (25–40
    kilograms). One of the smallest penguins is the blue, or fairy, penguin. It is about 14 inches (35 centimeters) in
    height and about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) in weight.

    Most penguins are black on the back and white below. They often have lines of black across the upper breast or spots of
    white on the head. Color is rare but, if present, is mostly on the head. For example, some species have red or yellow
    eyes, red beaks or feet, or yellow brow tufts. The emperor and king penguins have orange and yellow on the head, neck,
    and breast.
